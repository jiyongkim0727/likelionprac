    <p> If you’re going to share your home with a dog, you’ll need to deal with some level of dog hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some “blow” seasonally — produce a snowstorm of loose hair — some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you’re a neatnik you’ll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards. See Dogs That Shed Very Little </p>
