    <h1>Siberian Husky</h1>
    <p>The Siberian Husky is a beautiful dog breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings.</p>
    <p>Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia.</p>
    <p>It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but be aware that this athletic, intelligent dog can be independent and challenging for first-time dog owners.</p>
    <p>Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a fenced yard that is sunk in the ground to prevent escapes.</p>
